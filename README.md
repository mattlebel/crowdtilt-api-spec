# Crowdtilt API Specs (BETA)

The Crowdtilt API opens up the opportunity for developers to:

* Offer a group payments option in their applications.
* Offer a pre-sales commerce option in their applications.
* Develop a crowdfunding application (i.e., single project model like Lockitron
    or multi-project model like Kickstarter).
* Develop a social fundraising application.
* Enable the collaboration around these styles of commerce.

What we think is cool about the Crowdtilt API:

* Developers can use the Crowdtilt API with their own payment processor
    as it works with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/),
    [Balanced](https://www.balancedpayments.com/),
    [BrainTree](https://www.braintreepayments.com).
* Though we have the above preferred partners for the Crowdtilt API already
    built out and ready to use, our API is actually built around our universal
    payments interface, which allows developers to integrate any payment
    processor from around the world right into our system.  For more information
    about how to get access to this interface to build support for your favorite
    processor, drop us a note at [support.api@crowdtilt.com](mailto:support.api@crowdtilt.com).
* The API also works with credit cards and ACH debit payments or a combination
    of these.
* The API provides collaboration tools such as commenting/updates, nested
    comments, messaging, notifications, and tracking of those that have paid and
    those that haven't.
* The API supports both multiple currencies and international languages.
* We also provide a tool to tokenize the sensitive information you collect (credit card 
  and bank account numbers), so you don't have to worry about PCI compliance

## Introduction

It is important to understand that the Crowdtilt API is a layer of abstraction
on top of payment processors. Currently, we support Balanced, which is recommended
for multi-project services such as Kickstarter. We also support Stripe, which is
suitable for single-project services such as Lockitron. Finally, we support
Braintree, which is highly suitable for international projects.

When interacting with a payment gateway, the focus is highly transactional and
payment-based.  We consider a payment to be simply a part of a whole.  Our API
helps you focus on the whole.

The API defines 3 main objects: ``campaign``, ``user``, and ``payment``. At a
very high-level, a ``campaign`` represents a monetary goal that one or more
``users`` try to achieve through ``payments``. The campaign can define multiple
payment policies such as ``fixed payments``, e.g, tickets, or ``variable
payments``, e.g., donations.

``Payments`` are simply a way for users to achieve the campaign goal. We believe
that a good crowdfunding service should support any type of payment. Therefore,
we are working on supporting as many payment methods as possible. Currently, we
support credit cards and ACH debits.

When the campaign is created, it has to have at least one ``user`` to act as the
owner or the campaign admin. Once the campaign goal is achieved, the money is
sent to the campaign admin according to the policies defined when the campaign
was created.

Here is a full definition for each one of those objects:
[campaign](#campaign-definition), [user](#user-definition),
[payment](#payment-definition).


## Security

Crowdtilt is fully PCI compliant and security is of paramount importance to our
team. Crowdtilt forces HTTPS for all services, including our public website. All
data is stored in a Payment Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
Compliant environment.

Crowdtilt provides a PCI-compliant javascript library, `crowdtilt.js`,
which is easy to implement on your website. Sensitive payment information can
then be securely collected without ever touching your servers, keeping you
completely outside of PCI and regulatory scope. See 
[Tokenizing Sensitive User Information](#tokenizing-sensitive-user-information) 
for more information.

We investigate all reported security issues with extreme immediacy. If you
believe you've found any security issues, please email us at
[security@crowdtilt.com](mailto:security@crowdtilt.com). Though usually faster,
we guarantee a direct response within 24 hours. We ask that you do not
disclose a security bug publicly until it has been addressed by our team.


## Use Cases

The Crowdtilt API can be used in a single-project environment (i.e.
[app.net](http://www.app.net)/[lockitron.com](http://www.lockitron.com)),
a multi-project environment (a la [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com)),
or for simple Group Payments.  This includes things like group vacation
bookings/rentals, wedding gifts, bachelor parties, and the list goes on.
We know we're only scratching the surface of what can be done with this API,
and we're sure our users will find countless other creative and clever ways
to utilize our API.

We have friends looking to use our API to build a Mission-Trip focused,
non-profit crowdfunding platform, and other developers interested in building
a bill-splitting mobile application.  If you have any questions about how
your use-case or idea could utilize our API, don't hesitate to
[ask](mailto:support.api@crowdtilt.com)!


## Getting Started

The first step is to get an ``API_KEY`` and ``API_SECRET``. During our beta
program, please contact
[support.api@crowdtilt.com](mailto:support.api@crowdtilt.com?Subject=API%20Creds)
to request these.  Once you receive your Crowdtilt API credentials, you are
ready to use the API.  Remember that all API requests have to go over SSL.


### Sandbox Environment

To help you build your application, we provide a sandbox environment that you
can use for testing. Use the base URI below:

    https://api-sandbox.crowdtilt.com/v1

The sandbox environment will be configured with a free Balanced account. If
you need support for a different payment processor, please
[let us know](mailto:support.api@crowdtilt.com?Subject=API%20Payment%20Processor%20Sandbox).


### Authentication

We are big fans of simplicity. Therefore, we support ``Basic Authentication``
over SSL. You can simply use ``curl`` to test our API in 2 seconds.

    $ curl -u API_KEY:API_SECRET https://api-sandbox.crowdtilt.com/v1

If the credentials provided were invalid, the API will respond with

    401 => Unauthorized


### Data Formats

Currently, we only support JSON data formats. If you think we should support
other data formats, please let us know what and why
[support.api@crowdtilt.com](mailto:support.api@crowdtilt.com?Subject=Data%20Formats).


### Client Libraries

Unfortunately, we don't have client libraries, yet. If you write one, let us
know and we'll link to it.


### Hacker Support

We like hanging out on IRC, a lot. Feel free to come hang out with us #crowdtilt
at freenode. You can also send an email to
[support.api@crowdtilt.com](mailto:support.api@crowdtilt.com).


### Getting involved

We need your help and we would love to get you involved. Feel free to create
github issues, give feedback and comment, submit pull requests, or
review specs. You can even ask for new features and vote on the ones you like to
be a higher priority.


### When is feature X going to be in production?

Any proposed spec change will be in a separate "feature" branch. Once we have a
consensus from the community on the spec change, it'll be merged into `dev`
branch, which means that the <a href="https://www.crowdtilt.com"
target="_blank">Crowdtilt</a> team will start working on it. Once it is fully
implemented and ready to go to production, it'll get merged to the `master`
branch.

### Using Metadata

All resources contain a metadata field for storing key-value pairs of extra data. Store
as many of these key-value pairs as you wish.

Some common uses of this field include storing extra user data, such as address fields or 
profile image urls, or storing extra campaign data, such as a campaign description field
or campaign image url.

**Important Note:** 
Updating the metadata field completely overwrites its contents. Be sure to include
the entirety of the data you wish to store when making an update, including key-value
pairs that did not change.

## Users

### Create User

The minimum amount of information needed to create a user is a valid email address.

Keep in mind that the metadata field is a great place to store references to other user assets, such as
a profile image.

    POST /users

#### Example Request

    $ curl -X POST -H Content-Type:application/json -u key:secret \
    https://api-sandbox.crowdtilt.com/v1/users \
    -d'
    {
       "user" : {
          "firstname" : "foo",
          "lastname" : "bar",
          "email" : "user@example.com"
          "metadata" : { "img" : "http://www.example.com/path-to-profile-image" }
       }
    }'

#### Response Body

    {
        "user": {
            "id": "USREC5",
            "email": "foo.bar@gmail.com",
            "firstname": "Foo",
            "lastname": "Bar",
            "is_verified": 0,
            "creation_date": "2011-07-02T14:20:48Z",
            "last_login_date": "2012-09-22T01:55:49Z",
            "uri": "/v1/users/USREC5",
            "campaigns_uri": "/v1/users/USREC5/campaigns",
            "paid_campaigns_uri": "/v1/users/USREC5/paid_campaigns",
            "payments_uri": "/v1/users/USREC5/payments",
            "metadata" : { "img" : "http://www.example.com/path-to-profile-image" }
        }
    }

#### Response Codes

    201 => Created
    400 => Bad Request


### Verify User

In order for a user to receive money raised from a campaign, the user's identity
needs to be verified.  A user is verified by `POST`ing verification data to the
`/users/:id/verification`.

The verification data is as follows:

* `name` - should be the real name of the user
* `dob` - the date of birth of the user in the format YYYY-MM
* `phone_number` - the user's phone number
* `street_address` - the user's street address
* `postal code` - the user's postal code

In some cases, if the user cannot be fully verified with this information, we
may return a `449` response indicating that we need more info.  In these cases
you should re-post the data with the additional `ssn` field containing the
user's social security number for additional verification.

Once the verification has succeeded, `is_verified` on the user object
will be set to 1 to reflect this change.

    POST /users/:id/verification

#### Example Request

    $ curl -X POST -H Content-Type:application/json -u key:secret \
    https://api-sandbox.crowdtilt.com/v1/users/USREC5/verification \
    -d'
    {
       "verification" : {
          "name" : "Khaled Hussein",
          "dob" : "1984-07",
          "phone_number" : "(000) 000-0000",
          "street_address" : "324 awesome address, awesome city, CA",
          "postal_code" : "12345"
       }
    }'

#### Response Body

    {}

#### Response Codes

    200 => OK
    400 => Bad Data, or Could not Verify admin information
    449 => Retry with SSN


### Authenticate User

To authenticate a user, you can pass in the user's login credentials, email and
password, as query parameters.

    GET /users/authentication?email=user@example.com&password=mypassword

#### Example Request

    $ curl -X GET -H Content-Type:application/json -u key:secret \
    https://api-sandbox.crowdtilt.com/users/authentication?email=user@example.com&password=mypassword

#### Response Body

    {
       "user" : {
          "id" : "USRB07",
          "firstname" : "foo",
          "lastname" : "bar",

## Campaigns

### Create Campaign

A campaign needs to be associated to a user. We refer to this user as the
"campaign admin". Campaign admins can create campaigns without having to be
verified. However, they need to be
[verified](#verify-user) in order to [set up their bank account details](#create-user-bank)
and then be able to receive the money collected in their campaign.

The metadata field is a great place to store references to other campaign assets, such as
a campaign image.

    POST /campaigns

## Campaign Payments

### Create campaign payment

Before a user is able to contribute, they need to have a Credit Card associated
to them.  All amounts and prices used in this API are *always* in cents.

When creating a payment, the `amount` field determines how much money is
going to the campaign.  The `user_fee_amount` accepts a value that will be
charged to the paying user, on top of the `amount`, and the `admin_fee_amount`
will be taken out of the money that goes to the campaign admin when the campaign
tilts.

For example, if a user wants to pay `$20.00` to a campaign, and you want to add
a 2% fee to the user, you would send `amount` as `2000` and `user_fee_amount` as
`40` (2% of the `$20.00`).  The users credit card would then be charged
`$20.40`.  In the same scenario, if you wanted to charge 2% from the admin
when the campaign tilts, you would set `admin_fee_amount` to `40` and on tilt
the admin will only receive `$19.60` from the `$20.00` payment.

## Campaign Settlements

Campaign Settlements represent a disbursement of funds for a tilted campaign.
A campaign settlement will show you the `campaign`, `bank`, and `user` that the
`settlement` belongs to.  It will also show you the `admin_amount`, which is the
amount of money being sent to the admin's bank account.  The `escrow_amount`
is how much money from the campaign is going into your escrow account (it
represents fees charged to the admin and payers).  Possible statuses for a
campaign settlement are:

* `needs bank account` - this means that admin of the campaign needs to set up
  his or her bank account before the funds will be sent.
* `pending` - this means that the funds are being transfered to the bank account
  specified in the settlement.
* `rejected` - this means that the settlement was rejected and could not be
  sent to the bank account in question.  In these cases, the bank account
  can be updated, as specified in the
  [update campaign settlement](#update-campaign-settlement-bank) section.
* `re-sent pending` - this means that the settlement previously failed, but the
  bank account has been updated, and the funds are being transfered to the new
  bank account.
* `cleared` - this means that the funds have cleared the bank account and the
  settlement has completed successfully.

## Campaign Comments

### Create Campaign Comment

To create a comment, POST to `/campaigns/:id/comments`.
The only required fields are the `user_id` of the comment author
and the `body` of the comment.
The `title`, `parent_id`, and `score` fields are optional.
The `parent_id` is the id of the parent of this comment, i.e.,
the comment that this comment is a reply to.
This only matters if you want to support nested comments.
You may provide a `parent_id` of null for top-level comments.
The purpose of the `score` field is to provide support for voting on comments.

    POST /campaigns/:id/comments

#### Example Request

    $ curl -X POST -H Content-Type:application/json -u key:secret \
    https://api-sandbox.crowdtilt.com/v1/campaigns/CMPCCC/comments

## API Examples

### Create a User

Generally the first thing you want to do is create some users.  Let's
create two users, an admin, and a contributor.

    # Create the admin user
    $ curl -X POST -u key:secret  -H Content-Type:application/json \
        https://api-sandbox.crowdtilt.com/v1/users \
        -d'{
            "user":{
                "email"    : "user@gmail.com"
            }
        }'

    # Response
    {
        "user" : {
           "last_login_date" : null,
           "paid_campaigns_uri" : "/v1/users/USRC55/paid_campaigns",
           "is_verified" : 0,
           "uri" : "/v1/users/USRC55",
           "firstname" : null,
           "lastname" : null,
           "email" : "user@gmail.com",
           "creation_date" : "2012-10-31T00:41:55Z",
           "metadata" : {},
           "id" : "USRC55",
           "campaigns_uri" : "/v1/users/USRC55/campaigns",
           "payments_uri" : "/v1/users/USRC55/payments"
        }
     }

     # Create the paying user
     $ curl -X POST -u key:secret  -H Content-Type:application/json \
         https://api-sandbox.crowdtilt.com/v1/users \
         -d'{
             "user":{
                 "email" : "payer@gmail.com"
             }
         }'

     # Response

         }
      }

### Create a campaign

Once you've got some users, you can create a campaign for any of them.  For this
example, we'll make the first user created above the `admin` user, and use the
second user to make a payment on the campaign.

              "expiration_year" : 2032,
              "expiration_month" : "07",
              "uri" : "/v1/users/USRE32/cards/CCPA69",
              "card_type" : "VISA card",
              "creation_date" : "2012-11-01T20:57:20Z"
           },
           "amount" : "2000",
           "admin_fee_amount" : "200",
        }
     }

This payment will charge `$21.00` to the user's credit card (`$20.00` from the
`amount` field, plus `$1.00` from the `user_fee_amount` field), and the admin of
the campaign will receive `$18.00` from the payment (`$20.00` from `amount`
minus the `$2.00` set in the `admin_fee_amount` field).

Now you have created 2 users, a campaign under one user, and a payment to the
campaign by another user!

## Tokenizing Sensitive User Information

If you want to store sensitive financial information from your users (like
credit card and bank account numbers), you are required to be compliant
with the <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/" target="_blank">Payment 
Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</a>.
Crowdtilt handles this for you by providing a PCI-compliant javascript library, `crowdtilt.js`,
which is easy to implement on your website. Sensitive payment information can
then be securely collected without ever touching your servers, keeping you
completely outside of PCI and regulatory scope.

To implement `crowdtilt.js`, follow the steps below. You can also check out this 
[example implementation](#tokenization-examples).

### Include the Library
To use `crowdtilt.js`, simply include the following script tag on any page
where you will be collecting credit card or bank account information:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://api.crowdtilt.com/v1/js/crowdtilt.js"></script>

### Initialize the crowdtilt object
In a separate script tag, initialize the crowdtilt object. NOTE: this defaults to using the sandbox api when 
no parameter is passed to the init method:

    <script type="text/javascript">
        crowdtilt.init();
    </script>
    
Once you are ready to go to production, pass 'production' as a parameter:

    <script type="text/javascript">
        crowdtilt.init('production');
    </script>

### Make sure to create users first
Credit cards and bank accounts must be associated with existing `user` objects created through
our API. This means that you need to collect user account information in a step *before* collecting credit 
card or bank account information. See [creating users](#create-user) for more information. You'll need the 
resulting `user id` to create credit cards and bank accounts for that user.

### Create a Credit Card    
Once you have a `user`, the next step is to collect her credit card information and pass it to the
`crowdtilt.card.create` function along with her `user id`, as well as a function to handle the response
(more on that in a second).

Example:

    "cardData": {
        "number":"4111111111111111",
        "expiration_month":"03",
        "expiration_year":2023,
        "security_code":123 
    }
    
    crowdtilt.card.create(user_id, cardData, responseHandler);   

The `user id` should be the hash returned by the user creation API call, e.g. "USR1E0A9BCE5F6111E28F485D097AC0CAB6"

The required credit card data fields are:

* `number`: card number, as a string, without any separators, should be 16 digits in length, e.g. "4111111111111111"
* `expiration_month`: two digit number, as a string, representing the card's expiration month, e.g. "03"
* `expiration_year`: four digit number, as a string, representing the card's expiration year, e.g. "2013"
* `security_code`: three or four digit number, as a string, e.g. "123"

If successful, the response object passed to the responseHandler function takes the form:

    {
        "card": {
            "last_four":"1111",
            "expiration_year":2013,
            "expiration_month":"03",
            "uri":"/v1/users/USR1E0A9BCE5F6111E28F485D097AC0CAB6/cards/CCP59BCB06C601F11E28057FB337AC0CAB6",
            "card_type":"VISA card",
            "creation_date":"2013-01-16T20:57:34Z",
            "metadata":{},
            "id":"CCP59BCB06C601F11E28057FB337AC0CAB6"
        },
        "request_id":"REQ5735A0D8601F11E2998D00347AC0CAB6",
        "status":201
    }

If not successful, the response object passed to the responseHandler function takes the form:

    {
        "error": ... // A string or an object describing the error(s)
        "request_id": ... //May or may not be present depending on whether the error was found before or after submitting to the API
        "status": ... // HTTP status code
    }

### Handling the Response
When creating a card or a bank account, you must pass in your own callback function to handle the response
from our API.  The `status` property included with the response provides a handy hook to help you decide
what to do.

Here is a basic outline of what your response handler could look like:

    function responseHandler(response) {
        switch (response.status) {
           case 201:
               // The card or bank was created successfully!
               // Submit the data contained in response.card or response.bank to your server for saving
               // For bank accounts, remember to set the new account as the default in addition to saving it to your database
               break;
           case 400:
               // missing field - check response.error for details
               break;
           case 404:
               // your user_id is incorrect (no user was found)
               break;
           default:
               // Some other error ocurred, check response.error for details
       }
    }

### Create a Bank Account
Creating bank accounts is just like creating credit cards. First gather up the bank account information, then pass it to
`crowdtilt.bank.create` along with a `user id` and a response handler...but keep in mind one **important** extra step: 
When you go to save the tokenized bank account to your server (most likely through a request made in your callback function), 
you need to make an additional API call to set this new bank account as the 'default' bank account. See 
[setting the default bank account](#make-user-bank-default) for more information.

Example:

    "bankData": {
        "name" : "Bank Name",
        "account_number" : "1234567890",
        "bank_code" : "321174851"
    }
    
    crowdtilt.bank.create(user_id, bankData, responseHandler);

The `user id` should be the hash returned by the user creation API call, e.g. "USR1E0A9BCE5F6111E28F485D097AC0CAB6"

The required credit card data fields are:

* `name`: card number, as a string, without any separators, should be 16 digits in length, e.g. "4111111111111111"
* `account_number`: arbitrary length number
* `bank_code`: nine digit number, as a string, representing the bank code (also known as routing number), e.g. "321174851"

If successful, the response object passed to the responseHandler function takes the form:

    {
        "bank": {
            "account_number_last_four":"0000",
            "metadata":{},"id":"BAP5973D36A601F11E29CF3FB337AC0CAB6",
            "is_valid":1,
            "name":"Wells Fargo",
            "user_uri":"/v1/users/USR1E0A9BCE5F6111E28F485D097AC0CAB6",
            "bank_code_last_four":"4851",
            "uri":"/v1/users/USR1E0A9BCE5F6111E28F485D097AC0CAB6/banks/BAP5973D36A601F11E29CF3FB337AC0CAB6"
        },
        "request_id":"REQ5743854A601F11E2B79201347AC0CAB6",
        "status":201
    }

If not successful, the response object passed to the responseHandler function takes the form:

    {
        "error": ... // A string or an object describing the error(s)
        "request_id": ... //May or may not be present depending on whether the error was found before or after submitting to the API
        "status": ... // HTTP status code
    }

### Client-side Validation Helpers
These handy functions let you validate user input on the client side, leading to a better overall experience.

**Validating Card Number**

Checks that the number is formatted correctly and passes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" target="_blank">Luhn check</a>. Note that spaces and other punctuation are ignored.

    crowdtilt.card.isCardNumberValid('4111111111111111');      // true
    crowdtilt.card.isCardNumberValid('4111-1111-1111-1111');   // true
    crowdtilt.card.isCardNumberValid('4111 1111 1111 1111');   // true
    crowdtilt.card.isCardNumberValid('123456');                // false, too short
    crowdtilt.card.isCardNumberValid('4242-1111-1111-1111');   // false, doesn't pass Luhn check

**Determining Card Brand**

Returns the card brand based on the card number

    crowdtilt.card.cardType('5105105105105100');   // Mastercard
    crowdtilt.card.cardType('4111111111111111');   // VISA
    crowdtilt.card.cardType('341111111111111');    // American Express
    crowdtilt.card.cardType(0)                     // null

**Validating Security Code (CSC)**

Checks that the security code (also known as CSC or CVC)is properly formatted based on card brand

    crowdtilt.card.isSecurityCodeValid('4111111111111111', 999)   // true, VISA has a 3 digit security code
    crowdtilt.card.isSecurityCodeValid('4111111111111111', 9999)  // false
    crowdtilt.card.isSecurityCodeValid('341111111111111', 999)    // false, American Express has a 4 digist security code

**Validating Card Expiration**

Checks if the expiration date is properly formatted and in the future

    crowdtilt.card.isExpirationValid('01', '2020');    // true
    crowdtilt.card.isExpirationValid(1, 2010);         // false

**General Card Validation**

Runs the full set of validation functions, returns an error object that can contain multiple errors

    crowdtilt.card.validate({
        card_number:'4111111111111112',
        expiration_month: '01',
        expiration_year: '2010',
        security_code: '123'
    });

Returns:

    {
        card_number:'"4111111111111112" is not a valid credit card number',
        expiration:'"01-2010" is not a valid credit card expiration date'
    }
    
**Validating a USA Bank Code (Routing Number)**

Use ONLY for USA-based bank accounts. Checks against the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_transit_number#MICR_Routing_number_format" target="_blank">MICR Routing Number Format</a>

    crowdtilt.bank.validateUSARoutingNumber('321174851') // passes
    crowdtilt.bank.validateUSARoutingNumber('021000021') // passes
    crowdtilt.bank.validateUSARoutingNumber('123457890') // fails


### Tokenization Examples
Here we include two sample forms, one to collect credit card information and one to collect bank account information.

Included also is sample javascript to handle the data captured in the forms using `crowdtilt.js`. We use <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for convenience, but keep in mind that jQuery is not required when using `crowdtilt.js`.

            crowdtilt.init();
         
            var responseHandler = function(response) {
                switch (response.status) {
                   case 201:
                       // The card or bank was created successfully!
                       // Submit the data contained in response.card or repsonse.bank to your server for saving
                       // For bank accounts, remember to set the new account as the default in addition to saving it to your database
                       break;

# Pagination

All ``GET`` requests on collection resources has pagination enabled with a default
of **50** entries per page. For example:

    GET /users

    {
        "pagination": {
            "total_pages": 2,
            "page": 1,
            "total_entries": 100,
            "per_page": 50
        },
        "users": [
            {
                "id": "USREC5",
                "email": "foo.bar@gmail.com",
                "firstname": "Foo",
                "lastname": "Bar",
                "is_verified": 1,
                "creation_date": "2011-07-02T14:20:48Z",
                "last_login_date": "2012-09-22T01:55:49Z",
                "uri": "/v1/users/USREC5",

            .
            .
            .
        ]
    }

The default limits can be changed with ``per_page`` and ``page`` request
parameters. For example:

    GET /users?page=2&per_page=10
